        <p>
          Biomedical engineering is an interdisciplinary field that combines
          principles of engineering with biological and medical sciences to
          design and create equipment, devices, computer systems, and software
          used in healthcare. In Kenya, this field is rapidly growing as the
          country seeks to improve its healthcare infrastructure and develop
          local solutions for medical challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          Biomedical engineers in Kenya work on diverse projects ranging from
          developing affordable medical devices to improving hospital
          information systems and creating prosthetics using locally available
          materials.
